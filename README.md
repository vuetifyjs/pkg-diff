# pkg-diff

Diff two npm package versions **entirely in the browser** — no server, no
backend. Tarballs are fetched straight from the npm registry, unpacked, and
diffed client-side, with the line-diffing done by a **Rust → WebAssembly**
module. The whole app is a static site you can drop on any host.

## Alternatives

- [npmdiff.dev](https://npmdiff.dev/) – SSR, slow, no cross-package diffs, unknown source
- [MUI diff-package](https://frontend-public.mui.com/diff-package) – slow, crashes easily
- [`npm diff`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-diff) – CLI only, no HTML output, no filters
- other CLI tools – unmaintained, cumbersome to use

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Build

```bash
pnpm build      # type-check + vite build → dist/ (deploy anywhere static)
pnpm preview    # serve dist/ locally
```
