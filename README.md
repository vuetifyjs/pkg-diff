# pkg-diff

Diff two npm package versions **entirely in the browser**. Built as a static site
(no server, no backend) on top of [Vuetify0](https://0.vuetifyjs.com/).

The original manual workflow this replaces:

```bash
# download + extract two tarballs, then:
diff -r --exclude="*.map" --exclude="*.d.ts" \
  ./vuetify-4.1.0/package/lib \
  ./@vuetify__nightly-4.1.0-master.../package/lib
```

…now happens with two inputs and a button. The default comparison is the user's
real use-case: `vuetify@latest` vs `@vuetify/nightly@latest`.

## How it works

Everything heavy runs in a **Web Worker** so the main thread stays responsive:

1. **Resolve** — fetch the packument from `registry.npmjs.org` (sends
   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so no proxy needed) and turn a version or
   dist-tag like `latest` into a concrete tarball URL.
2. **Download + cache** — fetch the `.tgz`, storing bytes in the **Cache Storage
   API** keyed by URL. Version tarballs are immutable, so cache hits are free and
   never stale.
3. **Extract** — gunzip with the native `DecompressionStream('gzip')` (no WASM
   needed for this), then a small dependency-free tar parser handles ustar,
   `prefix` long names, PAX (`x`) and GNU (`L`) headers. The leading `package/`
   directory npm wraps everything in is stripped.
4. **Diff** — file trees are compared for added / removed / modified. Modified
   text files are line-diffed by a **Rust → WASM** module (the `similar` crate)
   that produces a unified diff; binary files are detected and skipped.
5. **Render** — results group by scope (`lib` / `dist` / `other`) with per-file
   `+/-` counts and expandable unified diffs.

### Layout

```
wasm/                      Rust crate → public/diff.wasm (C-ABI, no wasm-bindgen)
public/diff.wasm           prebuilt module, served statically
src/lib/
  registry.ts              npm packument resolution + version listing
  fetch-tarball.ts         Cache-Storage-backed tarball fetch
  tar.ts                   DecompressionStream gunzip + tar parser
  wasm-diff.ts             loads diff.wasm, marshals strings in/out of memory
  diff-engine.ts           tree diff orchestration (pure, runs in worker)
  types.ts                 shared, structured-clone-safe types
src/worker/diff.worker.ts  the pipeline, off the main thread
src/composables/useDiff.ts main-thread reactive handle for the worker
src/components/            DiffApp / DiffFileRow / UnifiedDiff (Vuetify0 + UnoCSS)
scripts/verify.mjs         Node end-to-end check against real npm packages
```

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Build (static site)

```bash
pnpm build:wasm   # only needed when wasm/ changes — output is committed
pnpm build        # type-check + vite build → dist/ (deploy anywhere static)
pnpm preview      # serve dist/ locally
```

`dist/` is a fully static bundle: `index.html`, hashed JS/CSS, the worker chunk,
and `diff.wasm` (served with `application/wasm`). Drop it on any static host.

### Rebuilding the WASM module

Requires the Rust toolchain and the wasm target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
pnpm build:wasm
```

## Verify the pipeline

Runs the real fetch → gunzip → untar → WASM-diff path in Node against live npm:

```bash
node scripts/verify.mjs                           # vuetify vs @vuetify/nightly
node scripts/verify.mjs vue 3.5.0 vue 3.5.13      # any two name@version pairs
```
